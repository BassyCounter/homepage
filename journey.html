        <h1>My CS journey so far...</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Starting with Python</h2>
        <p>
            The moment I decided to seriously give learning Computer Science a shot was roughly
            around 14 months ago, which was in 2023 at the end of February. Up until then, I knew
            very little about anything within the field, but I knew enough to know that it was
            something I was interested in pursuing. The course that I started with was
            an introductory class to scripting and programming with Python. The first week was
            slightly challenging for me, but it wasn't until I was nearing the end of week two that
            I began to feel overwhelmed with all the new concepts I was learning and was needing to
            learn to finish the course. The course was originally supposed to take 8 weeks, with
            the online textbook/labs being the main focal point for learning, as well as the
            projects and assignments the university was providing. It ended up taking me a few MONTHS
            just to get through the online textbook material just because of how slow I was retaining
            the new knowledge. Because of this, I figured after week two that I should take a break from
            university until I was able to successfully balance my learning with work/life duties.
            I was determined not to get discouraged with all the new lingo I was needing to know to get
            down the programming fundamentals. While I did take a step back from university, I still
            had access to the textbook material since it was bought separate from the included material.
            I spent the next few months using all the free time I had to study it, take notes, successfully
            complete all the labs, and absorb all that I could about programming with Python.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning by doing</h2>
        <p>
            One of the things I began to pick up on was that studying programming and hoping that it would
            just stick in memory wasn't going to cut it. I needed to take a hands-on approach and start
            putting what I was learning into practice by building projects. During the process of completing
            the textbook material, I wanted to build a project that would help me understand the new
            programming concepts, as well as help me with one of my hobbies: playing guitar. And so my first
            project came into fruition in the form of a study tool of sorts that I could use to help me with
            remembering music theory terms and their meanings. This
            <a href="projects.html#theory-guide" target="_blank">music theory guide project</a>
            was one that helped me with putting many things into practice such as
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Functions</li>
            <li>Loops</li>
            <li>Dictionaries</li>
            <li>Formatted Strings</li>
            <li>File IO</li>
            <li>Modular Programming</li>
        </ol>
        as well as a few others.

        <h2>Becoming more familiar with Python</h2>
        <p>
            After completing most of the textbook material, it became even more clear to me just how versatile
            Python (and most programming languages) are. I had pretty much moved on from the music theory project
            by this point, and instead wanted to try creating programs that were slightly more complex, with error
            handling and utilizing more intricate data structures such as nested dictionaries. A project I had in
            mind for this was a
            <a href="projects.html#book-logger" target="_blank">booklog</a>,
            which essentially allows the user to track when they started and finished a book, and save data to
            text and CSV files (as well as save information to a JSON file so that the program can read from it
            whenever the user launches the program and updates information.) The goal with this project was to make
            a portable program that could be used on any operating system, so long as the device in question has
            Python installed. I'm not all too familiar with Docker yet, but I plan on learning it so that I can
            make it even more portable and less error prone. This project really pushed my knowledge with Python,
            and allowed me to learn quite a few things I didn't even think I would need to know.
        </p>
        <p>
            By this point, I was spending many hours a day coding and studying so that I could get faster and do
            things more efficiently. I had finished the textbook labs and was ready to start becoming familiar
            with other languages and technologies.

        <h2>Getting started with Git and Github</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most important things for an aspiring developer is to have the ability to share and
            modify code with others using some sort of collaboration system. This is where I began to dive
            into the world of Git to save and track my progress. I still got a ways to go with how advanced
            my skills are with Git, but I hit the ground running when I first tried to learn it. I made
            flashcards for all of the necessary commands to know, many of which I have forgotten by now as I
            haven't been consistently studying with my flashcards, but I wanted to have something physical
            that I could come back to whenever I wanted to improve upon my knowledge.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Where do I go from here?</h2>
        <p>
            At this point of my journey, I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to keep advancing with. I
            knew that I was incredibly interested in the programming world, and I enjoyed coming up with
            fun, little projects that helped to benefit my everyday life and potentially other people's
            as well. But I didn't want to be limited to Python, and I definitely did not want to be
            repeating the same ideas and steps to create programs. I decided to take a step back from
            working on projects and instead wanted to try out some web development. I started studying
            HTML and CSS, watched a few tutorials for some ideas as to what I could do with the languages,
            and dabbled with creating stuff using them. With the help of
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a>,
            I learned some of the basics of HTML and CSS, and used the learning tracker to become familiar
            enough with them to where I reached the Intermediate rank within the pathfinder tool for both
            of the languages. I haven't been consistently utilizing these new skills so I'm a little rusty
            with both, but it was a breath of fresh air learning them and gave me enough momentum to
            continue with my journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I was definitely making progress, I still felt as though I wasn't learning material that
            was rich enough to really get me to where I was wanting to be. And so this is where I decided
            to dive into the CS50 course.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>CS50</h2>
        <p>
            While I was learning Python and struggling with retaining some of Python's capabilities, I came
            across CS50's Python course through a
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp's</a>
            video on
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
            and was very pleased with what it had to offer.
            The video I'm referring to can be found
            <a href="https://youtu.be/nLRL_NcnK-4?si=zOYQ78xIuHv7Hbtx" target="_blank">here.</a>
            Not too long after that, I became aware of how the CS50 coursework was available online for free!
            I had no excuse not to try it out, as I felt I was lacking some sort of structure with my learning
            and this was the perfect opportunity for me to continue my education and pick up some things I was
            unaware of along the way, things that could push me to the next level in my ongoing journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            I probably spent more time with the Week 0 Scratch assignment than I should have, not because I was
            struggling with Scratch, but more so because I became very immersed with the
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/979937052/" target="_blank">Maze Game</a>
            idea that I came up with. It's not the most breathtaking game visually, but it was the
            first time I tried to actually make a game, one that wasn't restricted to a program ran
            from the command line that didn't use very much logic and printed text as output to update
            the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            Going from Scratch to C was an interesting jump, and at first, I was beginning to wonder what
            I had gotten myself into. C was so foreign to me. I had never read a line of C code in my life,
            and the new syntax was kind of overwhelming, but the problem sets for each week of C were so
            engaging for me that I was determined to keep going, keep practicing with it and rewatching
            the lectures and rereading notes whenever I got stuck. I actually really enjoyed learning about
            C and growing accustomed to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the jump to Python came around, I was so glad to be back to something that I had started my
            journey with. I knew that the Python parts were going to be relatively easy for me considering I
            had already spent so much time it, even if I was a little rusty with some parts of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the SQL material presented itself, I was a little bit nervous because I knew it had to
            do with databases and such, and I hadn't spent much time with database stuff except for simple
            CSV files, but I quickly grew to like it and especially enjoyed solving the Fiftyville problem.
            I hope to use SQL more in the future and get better with it so that I can get used to joining
            tables and nesting queries, and be able to use more of the advanced features of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last but not least, the most current week (the one in which this website was created for)
            focuses on web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I am a little bit discouraged
            that the material hasn't focused much on JavaScript and instead we're needing to use other
            resources to get enough practice with JavaScript, I do have prior knowledge of HTML and CSS so
            this weeks problem set shouldn't be too hard for me to get a handle on, I just need to brush up
            on my JavaScript and try to use it more so that it isn't so foreign to me. As of the time of writing
            (typing?), I'm still not sure how I should go about using JavaScript to make this website more
            interactive. I did use JS to make the
            <a href="games.html" target="_blank">Favorite Games</a>
            page a little bit more interactive, nothing too crazy though. But this has been my journey so far, and
            I'm excited for what's to come!
