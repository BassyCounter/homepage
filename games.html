        <h1>Some of my favorite games:</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Pok&#233;mon</h2>
        <p>
            Pok&#233;mon was the first game that I was ever introduced to. I don't remember
            exactly how old I was, but I was in elementary school, probably in 1st or 2nd grade.
            I know it was the first game I was ever introduced to because I was gifted a purple
            GameBoy Advance with a few games from my dad on Christmas, one of them being a copy of
            Pok&#233;mon Silver. Now the thing about Pok&#233;mon Silver was that the game was made
            for the GameBoy Color systems, and those cartridges were quite noticeably longer than the
            cartridges built for the GameBoy Advance systems. I think that played a huge factor into why it
            was the first game I played because all of the other games I were gifted were on GameBoy Advance
            cartridges. On top of the size factor, the color of the cartridge was a light gray color as opposed
            to the dark gray, charcoal looking colors of the cartridges for GameBoy Advance, and the label
            for Pok&#233;mon Silver featured, what I thought of as, really cool artwork of a character,
            presumably from the game itself. I later learned that it was artwork of Lugia, the primary
            legendary Pok&#233;mon of the game.

        <p>
            The first Pok&#233;mon I chose however was Totodile. When I was tasked with choosing my
            first Pok&#233;mon, the one with my favorite design at the time was Totodile. Usually I
            go with the fire starter at the beginning of Pok&#233;mon games just because they
            usually are the strongest of the three and result in better outcomes in battles, but this
            was my first Pok&#233;mon experience, and I was also just a little kid. I wasn't very
            aware of how battles and all that worked or anything at that point in time. In fact, I don't
            think I ever beat the Elite Four with that save. Unfortunately, I gave away my GameBoy and my
            games when I was in middle school (a decision I still regret to this day).

        <h3>Living Dex</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout the years since I first played Pok&#233;mon, I would go back to it here
            and there just because it gave me some comfort with how simple and fun it could be.
            I've played at least one version of each generation of Pok&#233;mon, mainly because
            certain Pok&#233;mon can only be collected within a particular generation, and one
            of the goals I set out to achieve a couple years ago was to <b>catch them all</b>.
            Within the Pok&#233;mon collecting community exists a term called a Living Dex, which
            is essentially a collection of every Pok&#233;mon species, including each stage of
            evolution they exist in. Now on the surface, this doesn't seem like much a challenge,
            you would just catch every Pok&#233;mon you come across and then eventually you would
            have them all, right? Well... not exactly. You see, some Pok&#233;mon are mythicals,
            which are a species of Pok&#233;mon that are incredibly rare and aren't necessarily
            available within the games of that generation they were introduced in. A lot of them
            required you to go to specific locations in the real world and have them loaded onto
            your save of the game, and these were time-limited events. Other mythicals were only
            conceptual until YEARS later when they were released during some sort of event, much
            like the previously explained ones, or they were distributed online through what are
            called Mystery Gifts, which you can only claim one of (per save), and may or may not
            expire. All mythicals are considered rare, with some of them being always available,
            but only until you reach a milestone within one of the games, usually requiring you
            to beat the Elite Four (effectively beating the game) and/or completing the Pok&#233;mon
            entries within your Pok&#233;dex for every non-mythical of that generation. It's safe
            to say that if you acquired a mythical yourself, you put in a lot of effort. Even
            non-mythical Pok&#233;mon can be hard to acquire, ones that require trades to evolve,
            or have a incredibly low probability of spawning. Legendary Pok&#233;mon can typically
            only be caught once per save, and require the player to have completed most, if not all,
            of the game, and have a really low catch rate. The challenge of completing a Living Dex
            is not an easy feat, especially since new Pok&#233;mon generations are still being
            introduced every few years. However with all of that said, my Living Dex is looking
            pretty good! I'm only missing 2 mythicals, one of which is set to reappear as an event
            for Pok&#233;mon Go players in about a week and won't expire, so as long as the player
            works to finish the event (and hasn't already gotten the mythical within Pok&#233;mon Go),
            they're guaranteed an encounter with the mythical, and from what I can remember, the Pok&#233;mon
            can never runaway with events like this, so really the only challenge is the catch rate.
            Aside from the 2 mythicals, I have generations 1 through 8 complete, and I have most of
            generation 9 complete as well, I just haven't purchased the DLC that unlocks some of the
            new Pok&#233;mon that were released after the games were. There's a few paradox Pok&#233;mon
            I'm missing as well, but those ones were also released after the games were, and require an
            online membership for the Nintendo Switch to participate in the online raid events.
            I haven't been actively playing Pok&#233;mon for about a year, so I haven't been participating
            in those new events or paying for my Pok&#233;mon Home subscription (which is where my
            collection lives). I do intend on coming back to it at some point and updating my
            Pok&#233;mon Home Pok&#233;dex entries and finish collecting the remaining Pok&#233;mon
            that I have left.

        <h3>Pok&#233;mon Go</h3>
        <p>
            While I do prefer the gameplay of the main series Pok&#233;mon games, Pok&#233;mon Go
            is really good at making the aspect of playing with friends extremely fun because it
            requires you be with each other in the real world and go on adventures together to
            catch new Pok&#233;mon and battle gyms to earn rewards. It's a great game for people
            trying to get into the habit of exercising. You can go for a walk, ride your bike, or
            just drive around (as long as you're careful) and catch Pok&#233;mon in the process.
            I'm on Team Valor, what about you?

        <h2>Minecraft</h2>
        <p>
            My favorite game of all time is Minecraft. I have spent so many hours playing Minecraft, and
            I still have just as much fun playing it as when I played it for the first time. The only difference
            is that I have a lot more knowledge about the game than when I first started. Everything about the
            game I find really fascinating, from the abiiity to create/play mods, to being able to express yourself
            creatively, it's all super appealing to me. Nowadays, I mostly play in survival and like to build up
            bases that provide a lot of functionality, as well as look really cool and aesthetically pleasing.
            Even the simple things like mining and chopping down wood, I find very relaxing and it helps me to
            decompress after a long day. I'm not that great with using redstone, but the things that people have
            created with it is really inspiring. People have built flying machines, which are basically airplanes
            that are restricted to move at a certain level horizontally or vertically. Other inventions, include
            TNT launchers, binary encoders, and farms specifically created to automate the process of collecting
            certain materials. I find binary encoders particularly fascinating because they make it possible to
            create computers in Minecraft, as well as other machines that rely on the use of specific signals to
            achieve a certain task. The ability to use a sandbox world like the ones in Minecraft allow for the
            creation of so many unique things that you can share with friends or family, and create memories with.
            I don't think there will ever come a day where I stop liking the game.
