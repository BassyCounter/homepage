        </h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of this project was to help me practice with my Python programming skills,
            as well as to create a simple tool that I could use to help me with playing guitar. The
            project features a module that can be ran from the command line for simple use, and a GUI
            module that can be ran if you would like something a little more visual and interactive.
            The project mostly just allows the user to choose from a list of predefined music theory
            terms and displays information for it, which can be helpful for practicing improvisational
            guitar playing skiils and song creation.

        <h2>
            <a href="https://github.com/BassyCounter/book-logger" target="_blank" id="book-logger">Book Logger</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            I created this project to practice more with Python by implementing more complex data structures
            to mimic a book log that holds a book's title and author, as well as the time of when it was
            logged as started and finished. The data is saved to both a text file and a CSV file so that the
            user can view the book log information from outside of the program and have an opportunity to
            save it elsewhere, whether it be in the cloud, a USB flash drive, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Other Projects</h2>
        <p>
            Another project I started is very similar to the book logger and allows the user to input
            their favorite albums and who they were created by into a nested dictionary that can be edited
            if needed, and saved into text and CSV files for viewing purposes outside of the program.
            I haven't created a repo for it on GitHub yet, so it's still only local to my computer, but
            there's still some things I would like to add and improve upon before I would want to upload it.
            (Also created with Python). I do not know enough JavaScript to be able to easily translate it
            into my website in a fast enough time period that doesn't result in me finishing the website
            weeks later, so I'm not going to do that just yet, but I'll provide a link to my
            <a href="albums.html">Favorite Albums</a>
            that utilizes the information gathered from the CSV created with the program.
