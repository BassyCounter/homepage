        <h1>About me:</h1>
        <p>
            Hello world! My name is Michael, and welcome to my homepage! I have a little bit of prior
            experience with HTML and CSS, but not so much experience with JavaScript and so hopefully
            this homepage results in something that helps me practice what I've learned so far, as
            well as put some new things such as JavaScript and Bootstrap into practice!
        </p>
        <p>
            With that in mind, let's get on with some stuff about me! Up until around the end of 2022,
            I genuinely had no clue as to what I wanted to do career-wise. I knew that I wanted to pursue
            a career path that I could use my brain to resolve problems with, rather than my body, but that's
            pretty much the only thing I was sure of. Growing up, I didn't really struggle with class work all
            that much, in fact I never really remember needing to study before tests or refresh my brain on
            certain topics until I attempted college. I knew that I wasn't uncapable of doing something if I truly
            pushed myself to pursue it. It's pretty common for people to study to pass a class, so by that logic,
            it's probably pretty uncommon that I never really had to do that most of my life. I took a few advanced
            classes too while working towards by high school diploma, so looking back on that, I felt sure that I
            had potential for something more. What that 'something more' was/is, I'm still not too sure, but I'm
            hoping my journey with Computer Science and Programming gets me closer to that end goal. You can can
            check out my webpage
            <a href="journey.html" target="_blank" title="My CS Journey">here</a>
            for my journey so far.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, my favorite food is probably pizza (with the runner up of hamburgers being a close second)
            and I'm very much a homebody.

        <h2>Interests:</h2>
        <p>
            There are many things in the world that I wish to learn about and not just become familiar
            with, but to become well-versed in. I won't bore you with many of the more 'nerdy' interests
            that I have, but you can find some of the interests that I frequently pursue within the list
            below:

            When it comes to computer related stuff, or really anything that's an electronic and uses a
            mixture of hardware and software, I've always had a fascination with. While I dabbled with
            a very small amount of HTML while I was in middle school/high school and began to <i>scratch</i>
            the surface of programming fundamentals with Scratch in high school (pun very much intended),
            I never really bothered to try to dive in and give it my best effort to learn how to program,
            what technologies did what, and how they work together until roughly 14 months ago. As far as
            how things work on the hardware side, I'm still pretty much just as clueless as I've ever been,
            though eventually I do wish to dive more into Robotics/Electrical Enginneering concepts at some
            point. Ever since taking the plunge, I immediately fell in love with programming. After learning
            some of the fundamentals, it opened my mind to how versatile and useful programming can be. In
            today's world, there's not a single thing it seems that cannot benefit from the use of programming.
            Anywhere from creating a website to be usable from anywhere in the world, to creating programs that
            automate simple tasks and make systems more efficient, the possibilities are nearly limitless.
            While I still got a ways to go before I'll be proficient as a programmer, you can check out my
            current summary of projects

        <h3 id="music">Music</h3>
        <p>
            Music has been a huge interest of mine ever since around 6th grade. I remember distinctly the
            first song that sparked my interest was Paradise by Coldplay. I'm not sure quite what it was,
            but at that particular moment in time, that song fired a unique set of neurons that made me
            feel something about music that no song had ever made me feel before. Every since then, music
            became very closely tied to my identity. I would spend almost all of my free time trying to
            find more music that gave me the same kind of rush. My music taste has changed drastically since
            hearing Paradise for the first time, but that was a monumental moment for me that probably
            changed the trajectory of my future by quite a bit. 6th grade was also the first year that I
            was old enough to join band. I originally wanted to play French Horn, but I couldn't manage to
            blow through the mouthpiece, so I had to settle for playing the baritone. It wasn't my ideal
            choice of instrument, but I did stay first chair most of the time, and even got an award at
            the end of the year for Best Brass Player (of my school and grade). I didn't continue with band
            in the years following, but I did eventually find my way to learning guitar. I became quite
            interested in music theory along the way as well. The fact that there's words and formulas that
            are behind the scenes that explain why music sounds good is incredibly fascinating to me.
            Because music made such an impact on my life, my first programming project ever was actually a
            music theory guide of sorts. You can find it
            <a href="projects.html#theory-guide" target="_blank" title="Theory Guide Project">here</a>.

            I play games pretty infrequently these days, but they were an honorable mention because of
            the impact they had on my life as well as the above interests. If you're interested in reading
            more about what my favorite games are and why I like them, you can visit my
